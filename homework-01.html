  <ul>I am a recent graduate from Texas Tech University. My background in community involvement and love for helping others, joined with my natural leadership attributes , academic accomplishments, and experience qualify me for a career in countless fields. In 2016, while attending Texas Tech, I co-founded and served as a two term President of an organization which promotes philanthropy, empowerment, and leadership. I am proud to say that the organization, is still thriving today. In my free time, and as another source of income, I create innovative content through writing and video blogging. </ul>
